		<br>
		<h5><b>Tyler Obedience Club of Tyler offers American Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen Testing.  Please <a href="https://www.tylerotc.org/contact-us-new" target="_blank">contact TOTC</a> for evaluation dates and times</b>.</h5>
		<h3 id="title2">CGC Test Procedures</h3>
		<p>The purpose of the Canine Good Citizen Program is to ensure 
					that our favorite companion, the dog, can be a respected 
					member of the community. To receive the CGC certificate, 
					dogs take the 10 item Canine Good Citizen Test. Items on the 
					test include:</p>
		<h5><b>Test Item 1: 
					Accepting a friendly stranger</b></h5>
		<p>This test demonstrates that the dog will allow a friendly 
					stranger to approach it and speak to the handler in a 
					natural, everyday situation. The evaluator walks up to the 
					dog and handler and greets the handler in a friendly manner, 
					ignoring the dog.</p>
		<p>The evaluator and handler shake hands and exchange 
					pleasantries. The dog must show no sign of resentment or 
					shyness, and must not break position or try to go to the 
					evaluator.</p>
		<h5><b>Test Item 2: Sitting politely for 
					petting</b></h5>
		<p>This test demonstrates that the dog will allow a friendly 
					stranger to touch it while it is out with its handler. With 
					the dog sitting at the handler's side, to begin the 
					exercise, the evaluator pets the dog on the head and body. 
					The handler may talk to his or her dog throughout the 
					exercise. The dog may stand in place as it is petted. The 
					dog must not show shyness or resentment.</p>
		<h5><b>Test Item 3: Appearance and 
					grooming</b></h5>
		<p>This practical test demonstrates that the dog will welcome 
					being groomed and examined and will permit someone, such as 
					a veterinarian, groomer or friend of the owner, to do so. It 
					also demonstrates the owner's care, concern and sense of 
					responsibility.</p>	
		<p>The evaluator inspects the dog to determine if it is clean 
					and groomed. The dog must appear to be in healthy condition 
					(i.e., proper weight, clean, healthy and alert). The handler 
					should supply the comb or brush commonly used on the dog. 
					The evaluator then softly combs or brushes the dog, and in a 
					natural manner, lightly examines the ears and gently picks 
					up each front foot.</p>
		<p>It is not necessary for the dog to hold a specific position 
					during the examination, and the handler may talk to the dog, 
					praise it and give encouragement throughout.</p>			
		<h5><b>Test Item 4: Out for a walk 
					(walking on a loose lead)</b></h5>
		<p>This test demonstrates that the handler is in control of the 
					dog. The dog may be on either side of the handler. The dog's 
					position should leave no doubt that the dog is attentive to 
					the handler and is responding to the handler's movements and 
					changes of direction. The dog need not be perfectly aligned 
					with the handler and need not sit when the handler stops.</p>
		<p>The evaluator may use a pre-plotted course or may direct the 
					handler/dog team by issuing instructions or commands. In 
					either case, there should be a right turn, left turn, and an 
					about turn with at least one stop in between and another at 
					the end. The handler may talk to the dog along the way, 
					praise the dog, or give commands in a normal tone of voice. 
					The handler may sit the dog at the halts if desired.</p>
		<h5><b>Test Item 5: Walking through a 
					crowd</b></h5>
		<p>This test demonstrates that the dog can move about politely 
					in pedestrian traffic and is under control in public places. 
					The dog and handler walk around and pass close to several 
					people (at least three). The dog may show some interest in 
					the strangers but should continue to walk with the handler, 
					without evidence of over-exuberance, shyness or resentment. 
					The handler may talk to the dog and encourage or praise the 
					dog throughout the test. The dog should not jump on people 
					in the crowd or strain on the leash.</p>											
		<h5><b>Test Item 6: Sit and down on command - staying in place</b></h5>		
		<p>This test demonstrates that the dog has training, will 
					respond to the handler's commands to sit and down and will 
					remain in the place commanded by the handler (sit or down 
					position, whichever the handler prefers).</p>
        <p>Prior to this test, the dog's leash is replaced with a line 
					20 feet long. The handler may take a reasonable amount of 
					time and use more than one command to get the dog to sit and 
					then down. The evaluator must determine if the dog has 
					responded to the handler's commands. The handler may not 
					force the dog into position but may touch the dog to offer 
					gentle guidance.</p>	
        <p>When instructed by the evaluator, the handler tells the dog 
					to stay and walks forward the length of the line, turns and 
					returns to the dog at a natural pace. The dog must remain in 
					the place in which it was left (it may change position) 
					until the evaluator instructs the handler to release the 
					dog. The dog may be released from the front or the side.</p>
		<h5><b>Test Item 7: Coming when called</b></h5>
		<p>This test demonstrates that the dog will come when called by 
					the handler. The handler will walk 10 feet from the dog, 
					turn to face the dog, and call the dog. The handler may use 
					encouragement to get the dog to come. Handlers may choose to 
					tell dogs to &quot;stay&quot; or &quot;wait&quot; or they may simply walk away, 
					giving no instructions to the dog.</p>
		<h5><b>Test Item 8: Reaction to another 
					dog</b></h5>
		<p>This test demonstrates that the dog can behave politely 
					around other dogs. Two handlers and their dogs approach each 
					other from a distance of 20 to 30 feet, stop, shake hands 
					and exchange pleasantries, and continue on for about 10 
					feet. The dogs should show no more than casual interest in 
					each other. Neither dog should go to the other dog or its 
					handler.</p>
		<h5><b>Test Item 9: Reaction to 
					distraction</b></h5>
		<p>This test demonstrates that the dog is confident at all 
					times when faced with common distracting situations. The 
					evaluator will select and present two distractions. Examples 
					of distractions include dropping a chair, rolling a crate 
					dolly past the dog, having a jogger run in front of the dog, 
					or dropping a crutch or cane.</p>
		<p>The dog may express natural interest and curiosity and/or 
					may appear slightly startled but should not panic, try to 
					run away, show aggressiveness, or bark. The handler may talk 
					to the dog and encourage or praise it throughout the 
					exercise.</p>
		<h5><b>Test Item 10: Supervised separation</b></h5>
		<p>This test demonstrates that a dog can be left with a trusted 
					person, if necessary, and will maintain training and good 
					manners. Evaluators are encouraged to say something like, 
					&quot;Would you like me to watch your dog?&quot; and then take hold of 
					the dog's leash. The owner will go out of sight for three 
					minutes. The dog does not have to stay in position but 
					should not continually bark, whine, or pace unnecessarily, 
					or show anything stronger than mild agitation or 
					nervousness.</p>
		<h5><b>Equipment</b></h5>
		<p>All tests must be performed on leash. Dogs should wear 
					well-fitting buckle or slip collars made of leather, fabric, 
					or chain. Special training collars such as pinch collars, 
					head halters, etc. are not permitted in the CGC test. We 
					recognize that special training collars may be very useful 
					tools for beginning dog trainers, however, we feel that dogs 
					are ready to take the CGC test at the point at which they 
					are transitioned to regular collars.</p>
	    <p>The evaluator supplies a 20-foot lead for the test. The 
					owner/handler should bring written proof of rabies vaccines 
					and the dog's brush or comb to the test.</p>											
	    <h5><b>Encouragement</b></h5>
	    <p>Owners/handlers may use praise and encouragement throughout 
					the test. The owner may pet the dog between exercises. Food 
					and treats are not permitted during testing, nor is the use 
					of toys, squeaky toys, etc. to get the dog to do something. 
					We recognize that food and toys may provide valuable 
					reinforcement or encouragement during the training process 
					but these items should not be used during the test.</p>
		<h5><b>Failures - Dismissals</b></h5>
		<p>Any dog that eliminates during testing must be marked 
					failed. The only exception to this rule is that elimination 
					is allowable in test Item 10, but only when test Item 10 is 
					held outdoors.</p>
		<p>Any dog that growls, snaps, bites, attacks, or attempts to 
					attack a person or another dog is not a good citizen and 
					must be dismissed from the test.</p>
		<h5 id="title2"><b>CGC FAQs</b></h5>
		<h5><b>How much does the test cost?</b></h5>
		<p>The cost varies, but minimal, to have your dog tested.¾ If your dog passes, you will send in the original copy to AKC with a $5.00 fee to received your official Canine Good Citizen Certificate.</p>
		<h5><b>Can my dog be tested?</b></h5>
		<p>If dogs have been trained at home and are well-mannered, owners can have their dogs tested. Clubs and training programs in almost every city can provide CGC training to owners and dogs who need to learn a few more skills before taking the test.</p>
		<h5><b>Who can take the test?</b></h5>
		<p>All dogs, including both purebred and mixed breed dogs are welcome to participate in the CGC program. Dogs must be old enough to have received necessary immunizations such as rabies vaccines, and there is no age limit on the test. A dog is never too old to be a good citizen. If the CGC test is given at an AKC show, the age requirements for the show apply to CGC also.</p>
		<h5><b>Is the CGC an official AKC title?</b></h5>
		<p>The CGC award is not an official AKC title because the testing is not administered by our licensed judges. Owners should be proud of the award and recognize that the CGC is gaining credibility and recognition in our communities. Participating in this program helps spread the word about the importance of responsible dog ownership.</p>
