    		<p><span id="line1">Dog agility</span> provides great fun and camaraderie for handlers and their dogs. The first agility event took place in England in 1978, and the sportâ€™s fast pace, great spectator appeal and infectious enthusiasm guaranteed its rapid growth throughout the world. Racing against the clock, dogs perform an obstacle course filled with jumps, tunnels, a seesaw, A-frame, dog walk, and weave poles. Their handler directs them around the course using hand signals and verbal commands, and the goal is to finish the course with a fast and accurate performance. No two courses are exactly alike, which creates endless challenges for handlers and their dogs. Organizations such as the American Kennel Club (AKC), United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA) and Canine Performance Events (CPE) sanction agility events. While many handlers participate in agility as a way to have fun with their dogs, competitors can also earn titles, prize money and other awards.</p>
